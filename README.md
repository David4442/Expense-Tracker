## Features
- User-friendly interface for seamless expense management.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for expenses and incomes.
- Dynamic visualization of expenses over time.
- Seamless integration of MongoDB for data storage.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from [GitHub Repository URL].
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install backend dependencies(`cd backend`) using the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Navigate to the fronted directory (`cd frontend`) and install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Create a MongoDB database and obtain the connection URI.
6. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the MongoDB connection URI as follows:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here
   ```
7. Optionally, configure other environment variables as required.
8. Run the backend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
9. Then run the frontend
